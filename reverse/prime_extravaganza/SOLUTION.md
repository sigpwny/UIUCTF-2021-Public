# Prime Extravaganza Solution

1. Reverse the Binary
2. Understand the code (mainly the modulus part)
3. Find the correct inputs
4. What are the correct inputs?
    1. 19753
    2. 39506
    3. 59259
    4. 79012
    5. 98765

The way the code works is that it takes in a 5 inputs and for each of them it returns the highest prime factor. Once all the inputs are taken in, the code loops through the array that holds all the inputs and checks to see if they are divsible by (index * 19753).
