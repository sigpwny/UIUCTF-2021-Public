Steps:
- Read the instructions and look up MegaCorpOne (https://www.megacorpone.com/) 
- It's a fake company, its supposed to be part of an OffSec lab but I am borrowing the characters
- Go to the about section and find the CEO (Joe Sheer)
- His twitter is in the bio and you are supposed to compile a wordlist with words from his twitter and run that against the .cap file given
- The password is nanotechnology and the flag will be the same.
- Do something like aircrack-ng megacorp-01.cap -w /home/pass.txt
